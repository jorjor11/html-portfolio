<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Designer, Educator, and LBGTQ+ advocate. I am currently in the process of a career change and have completed an
  intensive bootcamp with Springboard in UI/UX Design and I am eager to put my new skills to use and see how I can grow 
  in this field.
</p>

<p>Previously, I worked at The Trevor Project as both a crisis counselor and a training specialist. My responsibilities included
  designing learning materials and workshops tailored for a divers group of adult learners. This role deepened my understanding 
  of user-centric approaches in crafting educational content. My work went beyond the traditional design;
  it was about making information accessible, relatable, and effective. Additionally, my role as crisis 
  counselor introduced me to the practical applications of psychology in communication and user interaction. Through this experience
  I learned the immense value of empathy and connection; principles I believe are central to creating compelling and user-friendly
  designs.
</p>

<p>My direct experience in design may seem minimal, but my experience is backed up with a master's in art and my recent completion of
  Springboard's UI/UX Design program, where I dove head first to develop and improve my skills in user-centered design, wireframing,
  prototyping, and team collaboration. I believe in constant growth and am always research ways to improve my skills, which is why I
am now embarking on a journey to learn to website design with code. Please follow along on my progress and let's connect!</p>
