<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Jim Henson played a pivotol role in my childhood and Bowie as Jareth rocked my world. I wanted to both be him and experience him.</p>

<h3>Batman Returns</h3>
<p>I fell in love with Michelle Pfeifer in this movie. It is, hands down, one of the best Batman movies of all time.</p>
<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>An amazing film about adversity, friendship, and healing from childhood trauma.</p>
