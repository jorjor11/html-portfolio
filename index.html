    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a UI/UX designer and trainer with a unique path from mental health support at The Trevor Project to the world of design, backed by a Master’s in Art and Design. 
    I thrive on using my strong empathy skills to deeply understand and improve user experiences. My background in psychology helps me tackle design challenges with a 
    user-centered approach, making digital spaces more intuitive and engaging. I love connecting with people and learning from diverse perspectives to create solutions that 
    really resonate.</p>
